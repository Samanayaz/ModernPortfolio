            <h3>Problem solving</h3>
            <p>
              While browsing the different footwear apps like Nike, Adidas, DSW.
              I realized the navigation is quite a struggle to get to your
              specific desired product, it was rather complicated. Shifting from
              vertical to horizontal navigation and finding main options after
              scrolling way down was not as pleasant of an experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another problem observed is finding the right shoe size.When I
              need to purchase shoes is even worse as I have to deal with the
              sizing problem Not just lengthwise but considering the different
              width of feet aswell. Usually shoe are ended up being returned if
              shoe doesn't fit the customer right.

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Everyone who loves footwear</p>
        <h4>Interview Insight</h4>
        <p>
          People close to me like my friends and family have shared their
          frustration of not being able to buy shoes online that easily because
          of stress of finding a right shoe size and they do not want to go
          through the hassle of returning them and wasting their precious time.
          Besides, it is good to highlight that even if in many cases the return
          is free. This is how my research began to find a solution that can
          improve the user’s experience when buying shoes online and that can
          somehow help to reduce the frustrations
        </p>
        <p>
          “I like to shop online from app but I usually wait for the refund of
          the previous purchase to buy something else! It’s almost an obsession”
          “I prefer to go out for shopping, if i get enough time, else I endup
          doing online shopping as I know that I can return the item for free”.
        </p>
        <p>
          “ Option to buy online for me depends a lot on the return policy. If
          it is not free of cost then I do not buy the product” “Sometimes I
          find my favorite shoe, but in real it is not as I thought and once
          worn I don’t like it anymore, and I return it” “I love shoes and even
          if I prefer go to the shop to try them on, I often end up buying
          online becasue some model is not available at the store, even thouh i
          know the risk of getting the wrong size”
          <br />
          So research has brought alot of points to light,not only related to
          the issue of finding product in reality,but also size of it, in many
          cases, the problem is not being able to see how the product fits.

        <h3>Sketches of UserFlow</h3>
        <p>
          The next step is, deciding the user’s flow to create the Information
          architecture of the App so to give a meaningful structure to the
          content the user is going to interact

        <p>
          After getting some positive feedback and suggestions about choosing a
          user flow from 4 real users, I finally come to decision that first
          sketch is structured with a clear idea of what are the steps one can
          easily follow.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          Before begining to design the UI, sketch & wireframes are created to
          test them on a few target users.
        </p>

        <h2>Final UI</h2>
        <p>
          Using all the best practices gained after analyzing the needs of the
          user, it was decided to get to the final stage of creating the most
          understandable design using the apropriate identity of the brand and
          modern trends of minimalism.
          <br />
          By logging in, user can browse easily and look for their favorite
          shoes. On product page, they can enter their foot measurements to the
          size guide, to find their perfect pair and minimize the hustle of
          exchange/return as a result.
          <br />
          User can immediately add their product to the basket and then always
          return back to homepage if they want, by clicking the main logo or
          click search to look for other products, orelse simply make a
          purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The final part of all the design thinking process is to test my
          prototype with real users. I tested “Shupa“ app with 5 users and
          overall, their feedback has been very positive. They all found it very
          useful with good aesthetics.
          <br />
          From a simplified navigation to creating a straight forward shoe fit
          quiz, It is easy to understand that, above design choice is
          definitely a try to improve personalized shopping experience and to reduce the effect of returns as to benefit the company. 
          <h5>Learnings</h5>
          Even if all feedbacks were positive,  I still believe as the next step can do more improvements and make some changes to the layout of size guide and quiz to make it even more simpler and easy to use.
