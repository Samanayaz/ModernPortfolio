      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>
        So the story begins from my journey of moving to United States of
        America 7years ago. I liked alot of new things I got to discover in new
        country like smores and snow. But at the same time I began to miss alot
        of things from back home. Most importantly chai-tea as I happened to be
        Chai-fanatic, set out on a quest to find a cup of the traditional ‘Real
        Chai’. To quench this thirst of tea I ended up with a plan to introduce
        a real Chai in America so not only myself but others like me who miss
        real chai and everyone else may discover a new favorite too. Another
        element that sits well with the culture and theme of chai is paratha.
        Parathas are usually very plain and simple flatbread that can be enjoyed
        by itself but everyone may not find this simple combination worthy
        enough. So now the challenge is to reach as many tastebuds as possible,
        Since the aim is to serve all the different cultures residing in USA and
        bring everyone together.. So I decided to have variety of fusions by
        combining different fillings in the parathas like phillycheese steak,
        Mexican style, pepperoni pizza, vegetarian. Even when it comes to chai,
        different flavors are offered like pinknut, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger
        and special savor’s chai which is simple strong bend of brewed tea and
        milk.

      <h3>Interview Analysis</h3>
      <h4>Insights</h4>
      <p>
        I conducted five interviews with college going students and young
        parents that work full or part times.<br />
        • We had a better understanding of how important is to get meals on the
        table everyday specially during hectic schedule, It’s always convenient
        to get flavorful meals from outside.<br />
        • Two of them said their partners usually prefers different origin of
        food. They end up paying extra for deliveries due to ordering from two
        different restaurants. “ I like bbq chicken but he always want
        phillycheese steak. No one wants to sacrifice their cravings after a
        long day”
      </p>
      <h3>Data Analysis From Surveys</h3>
      <h4>Insights</h4>
    <ul>
        • Majority of them like to have easy access to order food at home for
        convenience.<br />
        • Almost all of them prefer food that Is filling and reasonable at the
        same time.<br />
        • Drinking tea/coffee is major part of their routine to keep them going.
        <br />
        • Customization of ingredients to their liking is always a bonus
        </ul>
        <br />
        We determined from our surveys that we could make the impact with
        minimal change to our business model of this restaurant.

      <h2>USER JOURNEY</h2>
      <h3>Design Scope</h3>
      <div >
      <h4>Theme</h4>
      <p> Choosing colors for designs in general is not easy. I had to prioritize the colorful theme of truck art for this restaurant’s design.
        I began with creating an illustration of colorful kettle and cup as an inspiration after following the moodboard. I began with setting every component bright but it felt too overblown. So realizing can’t just choose colors for this project based on how I feel about them. I decided to let the overall layout simple and distribute some lively pop of colors throughout in the background paattern or buttons and pictures so the design compliments the theme without causing fatigue to the eyes.
         I’ve become more aware that knowing color theory, preferences and background of the client, culture of users and comprehension of your audience and competitors is the best way to choose right color for your project.

    </div>
    <div>
       <h4>Order for delivery/pickup</h4>
       <p>This restaurant is suppose to be open for dine in as well as for delivery/pickup. 
        So to include the ordering system in our digital solution, First I organized the feature of adding food items to cart to order online directly from the menu by placing “add to cart” button under each item. But it gave it a glance of more like an online restaurant so I ended up omitting that pattern.
      <br>
      Whenever I visit a restaurant/café to dine in for dinner, I like to look at the menu on the website beforehand. So I won’t find add to cart option under each item useful.  </p>
      <img src="../dist/img/savor/Menu mockup.JPG" alt="">
      <h5>Solution</h5>
      <p>I placed a single large button “place order” at the end of menu for users who would specifically like to order online so this button would take the user directly to the cart where they can fill their cart with personal choice of Paratha and chai by scroll down options. </p>

    <div class="wireframe">
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of an project before visual design and content is added. In the ideation phase I created wireframes presenting information architecture of the future layout.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="interface">
      <h2>Final Interface</h2>
      <p>Finally, after all researches and analysis were done I focused on designing all the screens through which a user will move, and created the visual elements — and their interactive properties — that facilitate this movement. I used things like patterns, spacing and color to guide the user and designed visual, interactive elements that respond in a way that feels natural to the user.
